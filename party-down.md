Step 5: Party!
==============

Have fun, and enjoy the event. Itâ€™s a great opportunity for you to share your thoughts and hear from others. Really the goal is to make new connections and generate interest. Slick ads and videos are one thing, but the kind of peer to peer communication facilitated by this event is the most powerful means of spreading ideas and information among the movement. For talking points or flyers, check out the issue cards on the resources page. These can help spark discussion or provide useful take-home materials. 

With your event, you will have helped us redefine public service and recode government in your own city. 

Thank you and congratulations!
