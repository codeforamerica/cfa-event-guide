Step 3: INVITE!
===============

To maximize turnout, we recommend a three step process: spread the word, follow-up, and reminders.

  **Spread the Word**
  
> To spread the word, your event page has an invitation tool, but if you have the time, personalize an email, including the link to the sign in page, and send it individually to each of your guests. Be sure to leverage your social etworking sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc). The personal touch is crucial for engaging your social network. To further raise awareness, you can customize and hand out the CfA fellowship flyers (downloadable on the [resources page](#)) in your workplace, local university/college, hangout, or community center.
  
  **Follow-Up**
  
> After your initial contact (via email, Facebook, etc), follow up. This step is crucial—and a good opportunity to catch up with friends too. You can encourage them to come and answer any questions. We’ve seen that the best way to guarantee turnout for your event is by calling through your list of invitees after your initial contacts. There are many ways to get people excited and committed. Remember, these are your friends; you know how to talk to them.
  
  **Reminders**
  
> After the follow-up, there remains one last step: reminders. Although it may appear redundant, we have always found that calling those key guests who RSVP’d on the day of the event goes a long way to ensuring turnout. Keep track of who you have contacted and who you have yet.
> Remember: turnout, turnout, turnout! Even after you develop and follow up on your list, you can still invite people you run into while doing errands or at work. And ask each person who says yes to bring friends!
