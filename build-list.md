Step 2: Build Your List!
========================

This event is about you mobilizing your social network, so invite friends, family, colleagues, or even that new hire at the other end of the office you’ve been looking for an excuse to talk to. Don’t just focus on your political or technology friends—reach out to everyone to come—and emphasize the casual, fun atmosphere of your event. The longer the list, the better! 

Most hosts will invite 50 people, expecting a turnout of about 10. Every person who shows up is one more towards our goal of recruiting thousands people into our geek army. Think of everyone you’d like to invite and then contact them through the event website via facebook, twitter, email, etc.
