Introduction
============

[Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/) relies on the idea that people across the country are willing and eager to get involved and use their skills to make a difference. 

Our [fellowship program](http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/) is only one way to make that happen. We want to spark a national movement of civic hackers coming together to build and implement innovative applications that change the way government works. Wherever you are and whatever your background, you can help. You can bring together your friends and other people in your city for meetup or hackathon. 

A local event can not only spark a conversation about CfA—and the opporunties in our fellowship—but also generate more interest in the idea of recoding government for the 21st century. We’ve put together some tips and advice to help you organize an event and be successful.
