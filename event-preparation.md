Step 4: Prepare!
================

You’ve got some options when it comes to the format of the event. You can make it a working session by hosting a hackathon over, say, a weekend, or you can put together a meetup or barcamp during the week at happy hour. You know your community best, so decide what makes sense to get people excited and in attendance. Some tips we’ve collected for either style are below.

**Hackathon**

We believe in bringing together smart and passionate people, and motivating them to take on hard problems with hard deadlines; that’s our fellowship — 20 fellows, spending the year tackling some interesting civic challenges. Weekend hackathons, however, can achieve the same thing by lighting a fire under that model: dozens of people in just a few days. To host a successful hackathon, we recommend three key ingredients: good developers, good data and good ideas.

* *Good Developers*: It’s been rightly pointed out that the cost benefit analysis for apps competition often don’t attract top notch developers: good dev shops would be spending too much time with too little pay out. It just doesn’t add up. That’s why the Donors Choose app contest is stressing non-monetary benefits, namely a photo-opp with the one-and-only Stephen Colbert. Follow that model by seeing what you can get out of local leaders or businesses. Of course, offering some money as seed funding for new business around the apps works too!

* *Good Data*: Getting together good developers without providing good data is like ordering a extra dry virgin martini. The glass isn’t just half empty; it’s empty. There is rightfully a big push in the civic space for better data, because it’s the lifeblood of innovative apps. Be sure to have some APIs on hand like Open311, the FCC API or PHLAPI. Check out Civic Commons’ inventory for a comprehensive list.

* *Good Ideas*: There’s a phrase that is probably overused but probably with good reason: no one has a monopoly on good ideas. Even if you pack smart people in a room together with the tools they need, that doesn’t guarantee success—especially under a rapidly ticking clock. Fortunately you can turn to the crowd for backup. Get everyone you know to submit their own ideas that the participants can hack together at the event. You can use the ideation platform we’ve already set up—with some good and scalable ideas already: http://codeforamerica.org/ideas

**Meetup/Barcamp**

Meetups don’t have to adhere to one format. Most include networking over cocktails and often feature a panel discussion or guest speak and Q and A session from the audience. If it’s you’re first event, you may want to try something more informal. Here are a few tips:

* *Make it free*: Free removes 80% of the barriers people have to attending, and it aligns with our mission of providing access to everyone. 

* *Provide food*: Whether it’s donating homemade cupcakes, asking for potluck offerings, or simply meeting at a restaurant or coffee shop, making food options available is always a draw for visitors.

* *Find a flexible venue*: A coffee shop with room for 2 or 10 will ensure everyone has a comfortable place to sit, just in case your RSVP list changes. Or most local bars will let you reserve some tables/space and may even throw in a drink discount.

* *Give them something to talk about*: You can make a list of questions to discuss and write one each on the back of index cards. Or have your guests do that as they arrive. Worst case, if the conversation gets sticky, play a round-robin game of buzzword bingo.
